{{dcl |
template<unsigned N, class E>
uint64<N, _DETAIL_> to_uint64( Vec<N,E> a );
}}
{{dcl end}}

Converts elements within a vector to 64-bit unsigned values.

The implementation behaves as if the following set of overloads is provided:

{{vset begin}}
{{vset1 h | Vec }}
{{vset1 | int8 }}
{{vset1 | uint8 }}
{{vset1 | int16 }}
{{vset1 | uint16 }}
{{vset1 | int32 }}
{{vset1 | uint32 }}
{{vset1 | int64 }}
{{vset1 | uint64 }}
{{vset1 | float32 | notes={{cap|SIMDPP_HAS_FLOAT32_TO_UINT64_CONVERSION}} }}
{{vset1 | float64 | notes={{cap|SIMDPP_HAS_FLOAT64_TO_UINT64_CONVERSION}} }}
{{vset end}}

The return type is a [[types#expr|vector expression]].

The conversion rules are as follows:
* 32-bit and narrower signed integers are sign-extended to 64 bits.
* 32-bit and narrower unsigned integers are zero-extended to 64 bits.
* if floating-point value can not be represented in 64-bit unsigned integer, the behavior depends on the instruction set used.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | a | vector to convert}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
A [[types#expr|vector expression]] evaluating to vector with values converted to 64-bit unsigned integers.

===Equivalent operation===
{{source|1=
r0 = uint64_t(a0)
...
rN = uint64_t(aN)
}}
