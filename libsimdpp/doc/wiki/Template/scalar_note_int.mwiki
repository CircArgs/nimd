====Scalar arguments====

Several additional overloads are provided to implement implicit conversions from scalar types. Values of the following types are accepted as the first or the second argument: {{c|int32_t}}, {{c|int64_t}}, {{c|uint32_t}}, {{c|uint64_t}}. Each element of the expanded vector contains bitwise representation of the source value, with the highest bits discarded if the source data is too large.

The return type is a vector expression. The vector type is the same as the vector argument except that masks are unmasked to respective non-mask vector types.
