Different instruction sets provide support for different operations. Certain operations can not be efficiently implemented in software, when the SIMD or even regular instruction set lacks support for the operation.

The following macros are provided to indicate the presence of instructions that allow efficient implementation of certain operations using SIMD. This allows the user to query the supported operations and fallback to another algorithm or even non-vectorized implementation depending on the instruction set.
